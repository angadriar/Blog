# README

Angad Singh: this was a project I did near the end of the spike, I didn't feel like I had a handle on rails yet so I decided to try to 
make a blog from scratch without help from a tutorial. I did google search stuff but didn't follow a tutorial step-by-step unlike the other blog i made. 

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
